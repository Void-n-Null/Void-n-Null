# Hey, I'm Blake

I build AI agents, game systems, and C#/.NET backends.

Early contributor to [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) during its pre-function-calling era—back when we parsed JSON tool calls by hand and hoped GPT-4 wouldn't burn $20 in an infinite loop.

Currently into: GOAP planning systems, ECS architectures, and spending nights in profilers finding hot paths for fun.
